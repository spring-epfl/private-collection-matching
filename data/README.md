# Data
This directory provides both raw data used in our experiments and measurement data.

 - `agg` provides aggregated measurement data and can be used in `bench/plotting.ipynb` to explore the trade-offs of different solutions.
 - `raw` provides raw measurement data.
 - `raw_chem` provides a sample dataset of 8,000 chemical compound fingerprints.
