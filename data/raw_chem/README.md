# Chemical datasets
We only provide a sample of 8,000 processed compound fingerprints in this directory. If you are interested in using the full 2 million compound database, you need to follow the instruction in the `chemistry` directory to read smiles representations from the ChEMBL dataset and use `RDKIT` to convert them into MACCS keys.

**Important:** We have scripts to automate chemical database processing, but handling the full dataset requires **~25GB** of storage.
